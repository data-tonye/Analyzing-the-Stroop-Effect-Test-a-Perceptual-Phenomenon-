# Analyzing-the-Stroop-Effect-Test-a-Perceptual-Phenomenon-
Project 5 of the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree(DAND)

# Project Description
In this project, you will investigate a classic phenomenon from experimental psychology called the Stroop Effect. You will learn a little bit about the experiment, create a hypothesis regarding the outcome of the task, then go through the task yourself. You will then look at some data collected from others who have performed the same task and will compute some statistics describing the results. Finally, you will interpret your results in terms of your hypotheses.

# Project Specification

**Responses to Project Questions**

*Question 1: Identify variables in the experiment*
- Q1: Question response correctly identifies the independent and dependent variables in the experiment.

*Question 2a: Establish hypotheses*
- Q2a: Null and alternative hypotheses are clearly stated in words and mathematically. Symbols in the mathematical statement are defined.

*Question 2b: Establish a statistical test*
- Q2b: A statistical test is proposed which will distinguish the proposed hypotheses. Any assumptions made by the statistical test are addressed.

*Question 3: Report descriptive statistics*
- Q3: Descriptive statistics, including at least one measure of centrality and one measure of variability, have been computed for the datasetâ€™s groups.

*Question 4: Plot the data*
- Q4: One or two visualizations have been created that show off the data, including comments on what can be observed in the plot or plots.

*Question 5: Perform the statistical test and interpret your results*
- Q5: A statistical test has been correctly performed and reported, including test statistic, p-value, and test result. The test results are interpreted in terms of the experimental task performed. Alternatively, students may use a bootstrapping approach to simulate the results of a traditional hypothesis test.

*Question 6: Digging deeper and extending the investigation. Question 6 is optional and does not need to be answered in order to meet project specifications.*
- Q6: Hypotheses regarding the reasons for the effect observed are presented. An extension or related experiment to the performed Stroop task is provided, that may produce similar effects.
